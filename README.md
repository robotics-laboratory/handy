# Mr. Handy

**Handy** is an open-source project maintained by [HSE Robotics Group](https://cs.hse.ru/robotics/).
Our goal is to design and develop a robotics manipulator that will be able to play table tennis.
All code, [datasets](https://github.com/robotics-laboratory/handy/blob/master/datasets/README.md),
models and development instruction are and will always be available online.
